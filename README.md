## The Zonation conservation prioritization framework and software - hands on workshop

This workshop introduces the Zonation software and its conceptual underpinnings, 
which have been developed at 
[the Conservation Biology Informatics Group](http://cbig.it.helsinki.fi/), 
University of Helsinki. The objective of the workshop is to understand the 
basics of the Zonation workflow from pre-processing of the spatial data to the 
actual prioritization, and finally to the interpretation of the results. We 
demonstrate the workflow by using real-world planning and prioritization case 
studies and associated data distributed during the training session.

**When**: Sunday the 2nd of August 2015, 08:30 â€“ 17:30.  
**Where**:  Agropolis International, in the Hibiscus room.
